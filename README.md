# 🐼 Pandas Data Manipulation Problems (PA3)

Welcome to the **Pandas Data Manipulation** problems! These Jupyter notebooks (`Leynes_Pandas-P1.py` and `Leynes_Pandas-P2.py`) guide you through working with **Pandas**, one of Python's most powerful libraries for data analysis and manipulation. The exercises are based on the **cars dataset** and focus on tasks like selecting, filtering, and displaying data.

## ✨ Project Contents

### 1️⃣ **Leynes_Pandas-P1.py**

This notebook introduces basic data manipulation techniques using **Pandas**.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Data Selection**:
  - Access specific columns like `'Model'`, `'cyl'`, and `'gear'`.
- **Indexing**:
  - Learn to use `.iloc` (by position) and `.loc` (by label) for selecting rows and columns.
- **Basic DataFrame Operations**:
  - Add and modify columns.
  - Filter rows based on specific conditions.

#### 🚀 Highlights:
- **Data**: Focus on the `cars` dataset, a rich collection of car attributes like model, cylinder count, and gear configuration.
- **Skills**: Strengthen your basic Pandas skills through simple, easy-to-follow examples.

### 2️⃣ **Leynes_Pandas-P2.py**

Building on **P1**, this notebook dives deeper into advanced selection techniques and solving "Problem 2."

#### Key Concepts:
- **Advanced Selection**:
  - Use `.iloc` to select specific rows and columns by position.
- **Exercise Problem 2**:
  - Focus on extracting the `'cyl'` and `'gear'` columns for specific car models (e.g., Honda Civic, Ford Pantera L).
- **Integration**: 
  - References Problem 1 for users to go back and review important concepts.

#### 🚀 Highlights:
- **Data**: Deepen your understanding of the `cars` dataset.

## 📊 Dataset Overview: `cars`
The dataset used in these exercises contains information on various car models, such as:
- **Model**: The name of the car.
- **cyl**: Number of cylinders.
- **gear**: The gear configuration.

### Sample Data:
| Model          | cyl | gear |
|----------------|-----|------|
| Mazda RX4 Wag  | 6   | 4    |
| Honda Civic    | 4   | 4    |
| Ford Pantera L | 8   | 5    |
